- 👋 Hi, I’m @sylviocjr and I live in Brazil. 
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a back end programmer or, even maybe a full stack programmer ... Not sure yet. I'm just giving my first steps towards what can be a new career for me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in Python. So, you'll find many codes in this language written to practice my very first skills as a programmer. So, I hope you understand the reason why they are so simple. Of course, there's a long way ahead. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... only time will tell (Nice song from the 80's ... Do you remember ? I DO !!! Don't ask how old I am !! LoL)
- 📫 You can reach me @ sylviocjr.dev@gmail.com
- These information are being updated as I follow through the steps of my classes and new learnings.
