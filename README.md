- 👋 Hi, I’m Sylvio Carneiro Junior and I live in Brazil. 
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a back end programmer or, even maybe a full stack developer ... Not sure yet. I'm just giving my first steps towards what can be a new career for me. Recently I got very interested in becoming a Data Base Analyst.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in Python and JAVA. So, you'll find many codes in these languages written to practice my very first skills as a programmer. So, I hope you understand the reason why they are so simple. Of course, there's a long way ahead. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... only time will tell (Nice song from the 80's ... Do you remember ? I DO !!! Don't ask me how old I am !! LoL).

#### What's new: 
- I also have to say that I am studying Mathematics bachelor degree @ Unisul and I hope to graduate by 2023.
- Recently I was admitted as a student of Data Analytics with Python. During this course we have online activities on weekdays, 4 hours a day, from 06:15 pm until 10:15 pm. This course also provides English classes and other very important subjects related to a future career as a Data Analyst. You can find more information on the website of the program (https://www.entra21.com.br/)  - Portuguese only - which aims the students residents in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil.
